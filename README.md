# GitHub App: Semantic Kernel with Dapper, PostgreSQL, and PgVector

For a comprehensive guide on building a Semantic Kernel using Dapper, PostgreSQL, and PgVector in C#, check out the detailed [blog post](https://davek.dev/beginners-guide-to-semantic-kernel-with-dapper-postgresql-and-pgvector-in-c).

## Overview

This repository offers a structured approach to implementing a Semantic Kernel that enhances your application's data handling capabilities through semantic understanding and vector representations.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Kernel**: Enable intelligent data processing and interaction.
- **Dapper**: A lightweight ORM for efficient database queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database management system.
- **PgVector**: Extension for managing vector data seamlessly.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Follow the installation instructions outlined in the [blog post](https://davek.dev/beginners-guide-to-semantic-kernel-with-dapper-postgresql-and-pgvector-in-c).

3. **Database Setup**:
   Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure PgVector as described in the blog.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the application using your preferred method (e.g., Visual Studio, command line).

## Usage

Refer to the blog post for detailed instructions and examples on integrating the Semantic Kernel into your applications.
